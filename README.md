# HBM Nuclear Tech Mod - 1.18.2 Definitive Edition
**This is a fork of MartinTheDragon's Port**
**This is a full rewrite of the Nuclear Tech Mod [originally created by HbmMods](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).**
It is currently being developed for the 1.18.2 Minecraft version.
Everything is still subject to change, even the speed at which blocks get mined. This mod is not ready for general use yet and everything is a work in progress.

### Development Builds

But you can still test the current state of the mod by either [building the mod yourself](#compilation-instructions), or downloading one of the [occasional releases published on GitHub](https://github.com/8BitKyanii/HBM-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT-1.18.2). Finding and reporting bugs is encouraged.

### Credits

For a (non-exhaustive) list of who worked on this project and the original, look at the [credits file](CREDITS.md).

### Contributing

Want to report a bug? Translate the mod? Make code contributions? We are interested! The [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file contains the information for you.

### Compilation Instructions

If you want to be on the razor's edge of things instead of just cutting edge, you can also compile your own versions of the mod.
(Note from 8-Bit: What kind of metaphor is that?!)

1. Fetch the source code

   For people who don't have a Git client:

   1. [Download the source code](https://github.com/MartinTheDragon/Nuclear-Tech-Mod-Remake/archive/refs/heads/1.18.zip)
   2. Extract the ZIP-archive

2. Open a terminal interface or [command line](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-commands-cli-tutorial/) inside the root directory of the project
3. Make sure you have JDK 17 (not JRE) installed and the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` [environment variables set up](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Environment_Variables.html)

   You can do so by entering this command:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

   The output should look something like this:

   ```
   openjdk version "17.0.6" 2023-01-17
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.6+10)
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.6+10, mixed mode)
   ```

4. Enter the following command to compile the project:

   ```bash
   # On Windows, you may have to use a \ instead of a /
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. Wait for compilation to finish (may take up to a few dozen minutes, heavily depending on internet speed)
6. You may now find a freshly-compiled snapshot jar under `build/libs` (only the non-slim and non-API version works directly as a mod).
7. Install the jar like any other mod

### Privacy

The mod won't spy on you or collect any personal data. That would be unethical (yes I'm looking at you, Microsoft).
However, it uses the Forge version checker, which fetches a JSON file with update information from <https://nucleartech.martinthedragon.at/raw/update.json>.
Any requests made to this domain and its subdomains will increment a country-specific counter, depending on the IP-address.
The IP-address isn't logged for me to see (which doesn't legally count as personally-identifying information anyway), and only the counter is kept for (very) rough statistics on how many people play the mod each day.
It is just a side effect of providing an update-checker service.
If you wish to not use that service for the sake of your privacy, you are free to modify the mod as per license by removing the line beginning with `updateJSONURL` in the [mods.toml](src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml) file and compiling your own version (Forge also uses that version checker system by the way).
